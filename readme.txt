3D Engine (BASIC)
by Georgios Patsos 

Version differences:

v1.0:
First release. Included for historic reasons. Use v2.0 or v2.5.

v2.0: 
slower but more precise, because it calculates the Normals by itself. Userinterface is not refined.

v2.5:
faster but not so precise, because it imports the Normals from Blender. Userinterface is more refined. It has also the autocenter and autoscale feature.

Introduction:
With this software you can render Wavefront Obj-Files on different homecomputers froms the 80's in BASIC. I will add more supported Systems from time to time.

The idea for this experimental BASIC renderer is from 1985, when i got a commodore plus/4, my first computer. Consider it as experimental, it won't render every 3D model perfectly, but you can achieve good results. I tested the software on a real plus/4 and with the Yape-Emulator on full throttle (2000%) and DRIVE 8 mode in IEC Level/Performance mode. 

The code is kept small by intention with a very simple user-interface to have more RAM for the model-data left. Its also written by intention in BASIC to be easy portable on other Systems.

Watch my channel to see some other models i have renderd with this small BASIC-Engine on other platforms like the Atari ST.


This small project recieved general positive recations. Many people from all over the world, sceners, 3D artists, artists, engineers (NASA), programmers, filmakers, teachers, university-professors, gamedevelopers, youtubers, hobbyists and enthusiast like me, also people who arent involved in computers, contacted me to express how much they like the renders. These simple wireframe graphics seem to have a generall appeal to everyone.

Their positive feedback always kept me motivated to improve this little programm and push the boundaries further and further.
